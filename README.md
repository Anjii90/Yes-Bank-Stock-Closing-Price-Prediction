# Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on examining the influence of the financial scandal involving Rana Kapoor on the share prices of Yes Bank, a significant institution in India’s banking sector. The analysis is based on a dataset comprising monthly stock price data from the bank’s inception, including values for opening, closing, peak, and lowest prices.

To forecast the closing stock price, two predictive models were implemented: a Linear Regression model and a Random Forest model. These models were trained using historical price data and derived variables such as the average of the opening, high, and low values. Feature engineering involved calculating the mean of these price indicators to enrich the dataset. Model effectiveness was assessed through evaluation metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R²), and adjusted R-squared. The Random Forest algorithm demonstrated superior performance, achieving higher accuracy metrics compared to the linear model.

The core aim of the analysis was to detect any notable trends or variations in the stock’s performance linked to the fraud incident. The feature importance output from the Random Forest model highlighted the primary drivers influencing stock price movements.

Ultimately, this study offers deeper insight into the connection between the fraud case and Yes Bank’s market performance, while also showcasing the value of machine learning techniques in financial forecasting. The outcomes of this research may serve as a valuable resource for investors, market analysts, and corporate strategists seeking to make well-informed decisions regarding Yes Bank's equity.
